## Syncing
Thank you for being so patient. I have manually validated your SSL certificates and now they are active.

Now you can force their installation by following these steps: 

- login to cPanel 
- open the Namecheap SSL plugin 
- go to the "Installed via Namecheap SSL" page 
- press on the "Sync" button.
